# ExoplanetDSLR
Observation of an exoplanet transit using a DSLR camera.

##Abstract
The advent of the new James Webb Telescope put a spotlight on astronomy and the search for new
exoplanets. Beyond the JWT, a lot can be done without such expensive equipment, opening the field to
a broader number of potential observers. Inexpensive consumer-grade DSLR cameras have already been
shown to have the ability to observe exoplanet transits. This paper explores if these findings can be
replicated in an urban light-polluted area. Following the American Association of Variable Star Observers’
guide on DSLR photometry [9]. We attempted to observe the transit of exoplanets around HAT-P-20,
HAT-P-22, and TOI-1131 using a Canon Rebel T3i DSLR camera and a 28000 mm focal length Celestron
Advanced VX Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope at the Vanier College observatory in Montreal, Canada – where
the sky’s brightness can exceed 17 mag/arcsec2[17]. The data was extracted manually, performing aperture
photometry using Iris [3]. The transit of HAT-P-22 April 2nd, 2023 was observed successfully, demonstrating
the feasibility of observing a transit using a DSLR camera in a heavily light-polluted area such as Montreal.
However, the observational data for HAT-P-20 and TOI-1131 is inconclusive, as no transit was observed
during the observational periods – expected transit times. From the results and the properties of the three
host stars, it is concluded that, under similar conditions, potential observable tansiting target stars should
be brighter than 10 mag with a transit depth larger than 0.01 mag. Furthermore, refining the observation
process could enable systematic observation of transits and the extraction, modelling, and analysis of more
precise transit data despite poor observational conditions and equipment.
